Neural Networks is a repository for interesting machine learning projects. 
In the future, I will experiment with different types of neural networks, 
error backpropogation schemes, and activation functions.

My first project is built from the tutorial contained in _Make Your Own Neural Network_ by Tariq Rashid.

Prerequisites:

Please use Python version < 3.0.  

You will also need training and test data sets. I have uploaded small sets, 
but you may acquire much larger sets from http://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/.

To run the code in the terminal, edit the paths to training and test data first. 

Then type

$ python neural_network_mnist_v0.py

Using the full training and test sets for one epoch takes approximately 2 minutes on my laptop;
it may take more or less time on your machine.

Acknowledgments

I want to thank Tariq Rashid for writing an excellent introduction to neural networks
and for the freedom to reproduce code contained in his book.
